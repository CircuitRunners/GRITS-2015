# grits_2015
Code for the GRITS 2015 season.

Drive Base: Mecanum
Manipulator: Forks attached to elevator pulled by winch (Talon)
Manipulator: Roller arms with wheels on end (Talon x2) and spring to keep tension in forks plus cable winched by window motor (Talon) for further tensioning.

Joystick: Logitech 3D Pro (x2)
Joystick: The primary stick controls the drive, elevator and rollers (in and out). The secondary stick controls the rollers (left and right).

Other notes: The motor controllers are not positioned correctly so the axis of the joystick are shifted around to compensate.
